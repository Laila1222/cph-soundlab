          Copenhagen Sound Lab is a music and sound design studio run by Edvin

          We specialise in music recording, composition, sound design, podcast
          production, post production, foley effects and mixing. We are curious,
          exploratory and visionary benders of harmonic curves.

          Ranging broad yet going deep into the exploration of frequencies, our
          approach is both scientific and experimental. We are not defined by
          the norm of traditional audio recording and processing, but go above
          and beyond in our search for the key to elevate every single project.
